# 3D Scene Project Reflection

## Designing Software

- **Approach to Design**: I approached software design for this project by first conceptualizing the 3D scene layout and functionality based on user interaction principles and aesthetic considerations.
- **New Design Skills**: Crafting the 3D environment helped me refine skills in scene composition, lighting effects, and creating a cohesive user experience within a virtual space.
- **Design Process**: I followed a iterative design process, starting with sketches and progressing through prototype iterations in OpenGL and GLFW until achieving the final scene.
- **Application in Future Work**: The design tactics and iterative approach I used are invaluable for future projects, ensuring efficient development cycles and user-centric design principles.

## Developing Programs

- **Approach to Development**: My programming approach emphasized modular code architecture and efficient resource management to optimize rendering performance and user interaction responsiveness.
- **New Development Strategies**: Incorporating shader programming and scene graph management were crucial strategies that enhanced visual fidelity and scene complexity.
- **Iteration in Development**: Iteration allowed me to refine features based on user feedback and performance testing, leading to more robust and visually appealing final implementations.
- **Evolution of Coding Approach**: From initial prototypes to project completion, I learned the importance of code organization and documentation, which significantly improved maintainability and collaboration.

## Computer Science and Career Goals

- **Benefits of Computer Science**: Studying computer science has equipped me with essential skills in graphics programming, which are pivotal for pursuing a career in software development or computer graphics.
- **Educational Pathway**: Computational graphics and visualizations have broadened my understanding of 3D rendering techniques and real-time interaction models, preparing me for advanced coursework in graphics programming.
- **Professional Pathway**: The skills gained from this project, such as shader development and scene optimization, directly apply to roles in game development, virtual reality, or simulation software engineering.
